# Flexbox and React Native UI
Quick weekend review of flexbox and react, built along with Code School's Watch Us Build series.

## HTML
The beginning and end files can be edited directly and viewed in a browser.

## Mobile
Full setup information is available on the [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) site, but this *should* work in Mac OS:

- `npm install -g react-native-cli`
- `npm install`
- `react-native run-ios`
